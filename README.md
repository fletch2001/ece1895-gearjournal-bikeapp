This is the repository containing my Pitt ECE1895 Junior Design Fundamentals Final Project for the 20230-2024 academic year.\
My main objectives for this project were to a) learn a new skill and b) combine my love for bikes and climbing into my ECE-related project. I achieved such objectives by creating an iOS application to keep track of my bicycles - the distance ridden on them, the make/model/years - a centralized repository of data to have as an easy reference. It's handy to know the mileage on a bicycle for resale and component replacement/maintanence. [Strava.com](strava.com) keeps track of mileage for bikes that get assigned to rides, however for example, with my commuter bike, I don't log those rides on Strava and I have to go off of a guess. Now I can log this in my app and have the data handy whenever I need it.\
My original motivation for this app was going to be as a companion app to a device that detects which bike I come home with and automatically sets the Strava activities since leaving the house with that bike to that bicycle. Below is a diagram highlighting how that system would work. <img width="484" alt="image" src="https://github.com/fletch2001/ece1895-gearjournal/assets/56126206/dbbcba78-c5f3-472d-96a7-45dd31a397ee">\
Shortly into verifying my prelimiary design for the bike detection device, I realized that designing the RFID system with enough range to detect a bike from ~1 meter away in less than 6 weeks was more than a stretch goal, and that I probably wouldn't be able to complete that within the project timespan. I then decided to pivot the scope of my project to the iOS app, so that I could still do something related to the original project but also stay true to my goal to learn something new which was iOS app development.\
While I already had some UI-oriented work experience from when I was a full-stack software engineer, I had never created designs myself nor had I implemented any designs in an iOS app using SwiftUI. Learning SwiftUI and how to make iOS apps has been a long time goal of mine, and this project seemed like a great way to both spend some time learning a new language and framework and put what I've learned to use.
